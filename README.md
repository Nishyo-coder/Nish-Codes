Nish Codes Now
## Description
Update: This new portfolio is a cleaner and more responsive application that my first go at my portfolio. 
The purpose was to use HTML and advanced CSS techniques, alternative frameworks and Javascript to build a responsive, mobile-friendly portfolio web app. 
- The motivation behind this starter website was to hopefully over time demonstrate my growth in coding.
- I built this starter website as a catalyst for my portfolio.
- I learned that many techniques can be used to create similar web applications. 
- Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Frameworks: Bootstrap, UIKit, JQuery, Google Gonts
