Welcome to my Creative Space
## Description
The purpose was to use HTML and advanced CSS techniques to build a responsive, mobile-friendly portfolio web app. 
- The motivation behind this starter website was to hopefully over time demonstrate my growth in coding. 
- I built this starter website as a catalyst for my portfolio.
- I learned that many techniques can be used to create similar web applications.
